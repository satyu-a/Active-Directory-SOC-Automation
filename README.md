# Active-Directory

## Objective

This lab aims to design and automate a Security Operations Center (SOC) lab that integrates Active Directory as the core identity infrastructure, simulating realistic enterprise environments. The project focuses on detecting, analyzing, and responding to adversary attack chains by automating log collection, correlation, and response workflows. This includes mapping simulated threats to MITRE ATT&CK techniques within Active Directory, automating detection pipelines, and orchestrating incident response to improve speed, accuracy, and resilience of security operations.
